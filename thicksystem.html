            <h3 style="text-align: center">Thick and Thin Systems</h3>
            <p>In the discipline of History, social and cultural history revived, in the 1970s, a type of textual narrative which became
              known as a 'Thick Description', a term coined by the anthropologist Clifford Geertz. This attempted to avoid perceived
              issues of social science, quantitative and structural history methods and instead used more qualitative contextual and
              interpretative approaches with an overall or underlying argument. This contrasts with 'Thin Descriptions',
              the original factual and linear history narratives that removed context and interpretation leaving only what was 'empirically' known.
            </p>
            <p>
              This return, or revival of, the narrative in the 1970s, attempted to provide a more accesible qualititative narrative but was better
              suited to microhistory that examined very specific historical questions in detail. Micro historians beleived that these detailed
              examinations support better generalisations and address larger questions because of better quality foundations.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, more quantitative data approaches were seen as poor in terms of results and the difficulty to critique, and while structural history provided
              highly complex landscapes it was argued that they lacked accessibility or were seen by some historians as deterministic. However, thick descriptions are
                still difficult to write well, and have their own limitations in terms of sophistication of argument and the ability to
                integrate and synthesise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most indexing or finding aid databases, might be equated to a thin description. They produce a database, and possibly, a network of facts
              without enriching context.

            </p>

            <p>Semantic systems like ResearchSpace might be equated to Thick Descriptions. However, unlike their narrative counterpartsm, ResearchSpace
              allows expressive contextualised data to be integrated and interconnected and therefore there is a direct relationship between the qualitative and quantitative but
              also different levels of generality can be supported.
