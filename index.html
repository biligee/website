<h1>ResearchSpace</h1>

<h3>The knowledge system for a complex and changing world</h3>  

<p>ResearchSpace is a collaborative Semantic Web environment designed to use and help build knowledge about the world and its history.  It connects information about people, places, periods, things and concepts from different sources without losing their original context, and allows the community to enrich information as a collaborative activity. It structures information as networks of knowledge supporting both a linear and non-linear approach to historical questions and encouraging different perspectives. It is open source, open standards, customisable and extensible, designed to be used with a wide range of knowledge based projects and applications.</p>
