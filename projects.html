                    <td class="cell2">Amara West is an ancient town in northern Sudan, the administrative capital of Upper Nubia, known as Kush,
                        occupied by pharaonic Egypt between 1500 and 1070 BC. Research fieldwork by the British Museum (2008-2019) has provided the
                        basis for a range of interdisciplinary research, based on architectural, artefactual, environmental, ethnographic and materials
                        analyses. The project thus aims to provide new insights into ancient lived experience, with particular emphases on cultural
                        entanglement (Egypt/Nubia), community vs state agency and techniques of production
                        The archaeological database documenting the excavation provides a reference point for understanding the site, its
                        buildings and the objects found within and around it, build on a single-context [i.e. stratigraphic unit] recording system.
                        However, the knowledge and epistemological investigation is contained not in the database, but with the experts, their
                        notes and published articles, and various unintegrated resources such as PhD theses
                        The fieldwork phase is now finished, with a final study season to be completed in Jan-Mar 2019.
                        The focus of the project team in the coming years will be generating knowledge (and questioning assertions)
                        prompted by evolving research questions, and dissemination of that knowledge.<br><br>

                    <td class="cell2">The overall goal of the project is to pilot approaches to facilitate Indigenous Australians’ access to and engagement with their distributed collections nationally and internationally and in regional contexts.
                        Reconnecting Indigenous Australian communities with ethnographic collections is central to contemporary museum practice. Yet, the historical dispersal of objects across museums, nationally and internationally, makes relationship and reconnection a challenge to communities and museums alike. By doing so, the project seeks to contribute to new theory around the ‘relational museum’, and new modelling of museum practice and museum development in Australia.
                        An important task in achieving this is recording Aboriginal objects in regional collections in the UK and working with curators of those collections to correctly identify and document these often poorly documented objects.
                        This project is part of a larger research project titled ‘The Relational Museum and its Objects’, led by Professor Howard Morphy of the Australian National University, funded by a Linkage Grant from the Australian Research Council 2016-2020.
                        Other institutions involved are working with local Indigenous communities in Australia. The British Museum’s role is particularly to research Indigenous Australian collections in Great Britain and to make these better known and available for further study.

                    <td class="cell2">The research initiative, Reshaping the Collectible: When Artworks Live in the Museum,
                        will contribute to theory and practice in collection care, curation and museum management,
                        and will focus on recent and contemporary artworks which challenge the structures of the
                        museum with a particular focus on time-based media, performative, live and digital art.
                        The research will be grounded in six case studies drawn from works in the Tate collection;
                        works which unfold over time and exist in multiple forms. These challenges the boundaries between artwork,
                        record and archive and rely on complex networks of people, skills and technologies outside of the museum.
                        The research team will work in partnership with a range of senior academics from around the world
                        who are positioned to open up new areas of scholarship.<br><br>

                    <td class="cell2">
                        The project combines both scholarly inquiry into a focused set of research questions and the
                        creation of an innovative bilingual online resource for Hokusai research.  Our questions
                        build on the pioneering research of Roger Keyes. The Keyes catalogue raisonné of Hokusai’s
                        prints is now held at the British Museum and is a primary inspiration for the project.
                        The project will complement their findings on Hokusai’s paintings, drawings, prints, and
                        illustrated books, by situating Hokusai more firmly in his historical and social context,
                        by developing their insights into his technique, and by exploring Hokusai’s thought.
                        We seek to understand: first, how Hokusai's art was animated by his thought and faith;
                        second, how Hokusai’s mature style synthesized and redefined the diverse artistic vocabularies
                        he had mastered earlier in his career, and how we can combine stylistic and seal analysis to
                        help identify Hokusai’s genuine oeuvre; and finally, how Hokusai’s work was enabled by the networks
                        that linked him to collaborators, pupils, patrons, and the public.<br><br>
