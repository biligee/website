                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>ResearchSpace is an open source platform designed at the
                    British Museum to help establish a community of researchers, where
                    their underlying activities are framed by data sharing, active engagement
                    in formal arguments, and semantic publishing. Using Semantic Web
                    languages and technologies, the innovations of the system are shaped
                    by a social conceptualisation of the graph-based representation of information.
                    This is employed by integrated semantic components aimed at
                    subject experts that offer mechanisms to create, annotate, assert, argue,
                    search, cite, and justify data-driven research. This paper showcases a new
                    onto-epistemological approach that supports researchers to contribute
                    to a growing and sustainable corpus of knowledge that has history, not
                    just provenance, built-in. It describes our considerations in designing for
                    interdisciplinary collaboration, usability and trust in the digital space,
                    highlighted by use cases in archaeology, art history, and history of science.

                    <h4>Abstract</h4>
                    <p>Technology is used to compress time and space but at the cost of ‘nearness’.
                        This means it maintains a distance between qualitative and quantitative techniques,
                        and between humanists and technology. The knowledge representations that humanists
                        require to investigate a given subject are not the same as those mandated by
                        technologists and database systems more concerned with scale and the efficiency
                        of data processing and retrieval, rather than context and meaning. This perpetuates a
                        humanist perception of information systems as either, useful but ancillary, or problematic.
                        This paper describes an intervention that seeks to combine the qualitative with the quantitative
                        through collaborative research,
                        expressive structured data forms, and a human centered and participatory approach to the
                        ‘knowledge graph’. Its design is based on an understanding of the history of the textual narrative
                        and the benefit of approaching quantitative issues from the bottom up incorporating different
                        levels of generalisation, perspectives, and a relational approach to time and space.
                        A specialist question based on the designs of the artist, Katsushika Hokusai is used as a
                        case study to illustrate how micro research questions can be expanded to address and contribute
                        to bigger questions and higher quality quantitative analysis.
